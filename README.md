## Near Redundancy and Practical non-identifiability: Survival Models


This repository contains real data applications and R code for the analysis of near-redundancy and practical non-identifiability of survival models in

Two real-data examples that illustrate the use of the proposed methodology for detecting near-redundancy and practical non-identifiability of parameters can be found at:

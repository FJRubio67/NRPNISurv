## Near Redundancy and Practical non-identifiability: Survival Models


This repository contains real data applications and R code for the analysis of near-redundancy and practical non-identifiability of survival models in

> Rubio, F.J., Espindola, J.A., and Montoya, J.A. (2023+). On near-redundancy and identifiability of parametric hazard regression models under censoring. [Biometrical Journal](https://doi.org/10.1002/bimj.202300006), 65: 2300006.

Two real-data examples that illustrate the use of the proposed methodology for detecting near-redundancy and practical non-identifiability of parameters can be found at:

- [Near Redundancy and Practical non-identifiability: Leukemia data](https://rpubs.com/FJRubio/NRPNILeuk)


- [Near Redundancy and Practical non-identifiability: Lung cancer data](https://rpubs.com/FJRubio/NRPNILung)
